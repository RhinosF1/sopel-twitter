# sopel-twitter

A Twitter plugin for Sopel.

## Getting your API credentials

[See here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started) for
Twitter's account registration process. Unfortunately, it has become a Process
with a capital P, involving manual verification & sometimes lengthy wait times.
If there was another way, we'd tell you that instead. Sorry!

Once you have a Twitter developer account, you can [create an
app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/create) for your instance of
sopel-twitter. Only the "(required)" fields are, well, required. No need to set
a callback URL, turn on "Sign in with Twitter", or any of that. You can use
`https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel-twitter` for your app's "Website URL".
